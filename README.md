# Advent_Of_Code_2022

## Welcome to my repo for Advent of Code 2022.
This year I decided to do Advent of Code using Go. I enjoy this Go because the syntax is like that of C, is memory save, and is a useful language for the work force.\


I will include a README in each of the day folders to talk through my thought process and my approach. I am doing these problems in my down time. I plan on going as far as I can without losing interest. Hopefully, that means until the final day.


## My Experience with Go
Go started out as a weekend project for me. I liked the idea of a compiled language with a similar syntax of that of C and shared aspects with higher level languages (slices, garbage collector, dynamic typing, etc.). For me Go is a toy language where I can write fast, readable code in a short amount of time. Since that weekend I have progressively written less and less code in Go. I hope to get more familiar with the language through these challenges. If any of the solutions seemed over-engineered, it is probably because I wanted to experiment with features and learn how they work.
